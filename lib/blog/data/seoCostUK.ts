  p("One of the first questions that every business owner has is how much does an SEO in the UK cost?"),
  p("The simple truth is that there is no single answer. While some businesses have a budget as small as £300 per month, other firms spend millions of pounds on regular campaigns providing measurable results in the long term."),
  p("That price difference relates to diversity in the type of results you want from SEO, the kind of competition in the marketplace, and the type of agency you hire--be it a solo operator or small agency, or a huge enterprise-level SEO firm."),
  p("Most importantly, however, you must forget that SEO is an investment in the digital growth of your brand, not an expense."),
  p('If done right, it should ensure <a href="/blog/10-proven-seo-strategies-to-boost-seo-organic-traffic" class="underline text-[#6FAF4E]">steady organic traffic</a> generation, the generation of quality leads, and strong aura building, which compound over time.'),

  p("SEO is not a standalone work; it is based on a combination of different types of strategies, such as technical, content, and off-page strategies."),

  h3("6. Time and Commitment"),
  p("SEO is a long-term engagement. However, measurable results usually manifest between three and six months. The longer and more consistently the campaign is run, the better the ROI will be the ROI, but also the higher the cost."),
