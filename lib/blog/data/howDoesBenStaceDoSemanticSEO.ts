  h1("Understanding Semantic SEO"),
  h2("What is Semantic SEO?"),
  p("Semantic SEO is an optimisation strategy that concentrates on the relevance and the context of the questions put to the search engine, rather than just the keywords. It utilises semantic analysis to figure out the user's intent and deliver the content that is most suitable to the user's needs."),
  p("The semantic SEO techniques include producing content that has semantic meaning, thus making it easier for search engines like Google to comprehend the content's authority and the relevance of the information. Leaders such as Ben Stace employ organised data and semantic content networks to facilitate prominence and to elevate their position in the ranking."),
  h2("The Importance of Semantic SEO in Modern Marketing"),

  h2("How Semantic SEO Differs from Traditional SEO"),

On the other hand, semantic SEO is all about grasping the meaning of the users' queries and producing content that, in fact, includes a variety of related subtopics."),
  p("Traditional SEO still uses keyword density and backlinks as its main tools, whereas semantic SEO is all about creating semantic relationships and giving complete information that meets the users' intent. I would say that Ben Stace's semantic SEO is not so much about just optimising the keywords but rather about producing well-structured content that delivers the necessary information and is still relevant."),
