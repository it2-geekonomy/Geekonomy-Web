  p("Local SEO, short for local search engine optimisation, is a distinct part of SEO that revolves around tweaking a business's digital footprint in such a way as to bring in customers through locally relevant searches. In contrast to regular SEO, which focuses on wider search terms, local SEO is all about getting results for 'near me' searches and location-based keywords so that your business can be the one that clients come across online. The process also involves making sure your Google Business profile is in top shape, getting local citations, and confirming that your website is geared towards local search terms."),
