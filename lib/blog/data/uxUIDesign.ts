  list('<ul><li>A comparison of John Lewis and ASOS is a simple way to understand the difference:</li><li><strong>John Lewis:</strong> Adopts a serene design with pastel colours, simple fonts, and a lot of space. It gives the feeling of being reliable, timeless, and professional.</li><li><strong>ASOS:</strong> Characterised by the use of bold fonts, big photos, and a more lively layout. It gives the feeling of being up-to-date, fast-paced, and targeted at young shoppers.</li></ul>'),

  p("Good UX and UI design not only beautifies a website but also helps a business to grow. Usually, when companies invest in good design, they get a much higher return on the investment."),
  p("Some businesses can generate up to £100 for every £1 that they spend. That is a giant success."),
  p("The power of a properly designed website is also in its ability to attract new customers. Indeed, the right design can bring about a 400% increase in results."),
  p("Therefore, if currently 2 out of 100 people make a purchase, an improved design could increase that to 8 out of 100. And thus, there is no further need to spend more money on advertising; the website itself becomes more efficient."),
  p("It is also true that even tiny steps, such as simplifying the checkout process or making the important buttons more visible, can have a significant impact."),
  p("Moreover, excellent design is an incentive for people to come back. Providing a website that is quick, user-friendly, and attractive to the eye, customers will be more willing to return."),
  p("Approximately 90% of users say that they revisit a website because of a good experience. However, if your site is slow or complicated, users might leave, and some of them won't come back."),
  p("Another benefit of good design is fewer confusion and support calls. When the website is perfectly designed, customers won't need support, as they will find everything by themselves."),
  p("Small things like simple navigation or a well-structured FAQ can save time and make both the user and the business less stressed."),
  p("In the end, design is also a factor that influences the very first impressions. People see your website first most of the time. If it looks neat, up-to-date, and well-arranged, it helps to create trust."),
  p("A shabby or untidy-looking website might make people question the business. According to the studies, 75% of people consider a company to be trustworthy or not depending on the way its website looks."),
  h2("UK Market Considerations"),
  p("People in the UK expect websites and mobile applications to be efficient and without any problems."),
  p("They are accustomed to fast and well-structured platforms like Amazon, Deliveroo, and Monzo."),
  p("Thus, if the website is slow and confusing or if it has an old-fashioned look, a large number of users will abandon the site immediately, and a competitor will be their choice. In general, people here do not give second chances."),
  p("One more thing that is quite important is the use of mobile phones. Most of the people in the UK at present access the internet through their mobile phones, and more than half of the online transactions are carried out using mobiles."),
  p("Therefore, a website's compatibility with a phone screen alone is not sufficient; it must primarily cater to mobile usage. If a phone user has difficulties accessing a website, a business can lose its customers."),
  p("Accessibility has always been quite an issue. The Equality Act 2010 is a law that demands websites and mobile applications provide services for people with disabilities, for example, those who have problems with their vision or hearing."),
  p("The failure to follow these regulations may cause the company to have legal issues. Besides the law, it is also a good business idea since the number of disabled people in the UK is more than 14 million."),
  p("Making a website accessible means more people can use it and feel included."),
  p("In conclusion, besides GDPR and cookie consent rules, design is also affected by them. Websites need to get consent from users before taking their data. However, the manner in which this is accomplished should be kept simple and user-friendly."),
  p("Users should be able to see through their working day without feeling disturbed by intrusive pop-ups, and it should be easy for them to close pop-ups. The aim is to comply with laws while doing it quietly and respectfully."),
  h2("Competitive Advantage"),
  p("Nowadays, most people would actually check up on a brand through the World Wide Web prior to any in-person or call conversation with the company. That's why a well-crafted design has become the biggest edge for businesses in the UK."),
  p("I wonder if any brand, whether it is in shopping, finance, food delivery, or services, has its websites and apps in such a state that they are constantly upgrading them."),
  p("They get one important thing: if customers feel using their platform is easy, smooth, and fun, they can hardly resist making their choice and staying loyal to their brands."),
  p("Thus, even if a company offers the same product at a similar price, the one with the best customer experience probably gets the customers."),
  p("Monzo is a perfect example of this."),
  p("They didn't become big because they offered products with complicated features or that had higher interest rates. It was simply that they made banking easy and stress-free that they became famous."),
  p("Their minimalist style, real-time alerts, and user-friendly tools were the factors that helped the bank go from ordinary to extraordinary."),
  p("Consequently, the trend of designing better has been set by well-known banks to confront the competition. That shows how powerful good UX and UI can be."),
  p("Deliveroo is likewise a good example. The delivery and service are what matter most, although the design of the app is what contributed largely to the success."),
  p("With the app, one can comfortably view foods, make an order, follow the delivery, and pay promptly. Their growth strategy has largely been through the creation of their simple user experience that has enabled a rapid spread of customer loyalty throughout the UK."),
  p("Moreover, a poorly designed website is a situation that can escalate quite drastically."),
  p("About a good majority of 70% of the UK's online shopping baskets get abandoned, and the checkouts are one of the main reasons for this, as they tend to be long, confusing, and slow."),
  p("Bad UX/UI can produce negative reviews, an unattractive user base, ineffective marketing spending, and sales, which are going to be the downside of your business initiative."),
  p("Users, having troubles with a particular site, not only abandon it, but also choose to go straight to an opponent as well."),

  h1("Core Elements of Good UX/UI Design"),
  img(`${imageDir}/UXUI Design UK image4.webp`, "Core Elements of Good UX/UI Design"),
  p("Good design is basically understanding who you are designing for. Without understanding your users, their needs, their wants, and even the things that annoy them while they are online, it is impossible to create a smooth and useful experience."),
  p("The first question, then, is: Who are your customers in the UK?"),
  p("However, this is not only about age or location. It is also about how tech-savvy they are, what kind of devices they use the most, and what sort of online experience they expect."),
  p("As an instance:"),
  p("A 25-year-old London resident buying trainers will definitely expect a fast, modern, and mobile-friendly website."),
  p("A 60-year-old in the countryside of Wales who is booking a plumber might require clearer text, simple steps, and an intuitive layout."),
  p("To know users the right way, real research is a must, no guessing. It can be in the form of surveys, brief interviews, support message analysis, or people's usage of the current website observation."),
  p("By conducting this research, you can identify areas of confusion, hesitation, and the point at which users abandon the site. These insights are very valuable because they point you in the direction of what needs to be fixed."),
  h2("Information Architecture"),
  p("Information Architecture (IA) is the manner in which your website or app is laid out. It lets users carry on with their search for a particular thing with the least possible confusion."),
  p("Good structural organization ought to be user-friendly, not just a business word. Thus, for instance, clients don't get how the internal team works in support. When they require assistance, they will scarcely think of \"Customer Operations,\" but rather they will look for \"Help,\" \"Support,\" or \"Contact Us.\""),
  p("Additionally, your menu should appear as if it is in line with the user's expectations. There are particular sequences that people have gotten used to online, especially in the UK. For example:"),
  p("Once anyone clicks the logo, it should definitely take him/her to the homepage."),
  p("It should be as easy as pie to locate the contact information."),
  p("Items of the menu should be like bookmarks that stay on every page; thus, you will move from one page to another, though the items will be in one place, but you will see them on every page."),
  p("One may feel the urge to be out of the ordinary with menu names and the arrangement of the layout, but at all times it should be first and foremost clear to the people. If people need to make a little pause and think, then it is not going well."),
  p("An additional part of IA is figuring out which information deserves to come first and then displaying it clearly. Designers use a variety of techniques, such as spacing, size, color, and layout, to help the user focus."),
  p("On a homepage, users should be able to grasp:"),
  list('<ul><li>The identity of the company</li><li>The goods or services the company offers</li><li>What is their next step should be</li><li>This might be scheduling a service, looking at products, or gaining more information.</li></ul>'),
  p("When information is well set up, users are not required to hunt through or make guesses. It all appears to be simple, transparent, and without any pressure, and that is what good IA is."),
  h2("Visual Design Principles"),
  p("Visual design is the aspect of your site or app that individuals interact with initially. It's basically the return of your brand's look and character."),
  p("One of the most significant principles is always consistency. Any page should not only be identical in style but also be like brothers and sisters from the same family."),
  p("Thus, the same colours, fonts, buttons, and spacing should be used everywhere."),
  p("When every detail corresponds, the journey feels flawless and professional. Also, this makes customers more confident in your brand."),
  p("Moreover, your visual style has to be in line with your brand's voice. For instance:"),
  list('<ul><li>A law firm could feature calm, simple, and professional designs.</li><li>A children\'s brand could feature bright colors and playful styles.</li></ul>'),
  list('<ul><li>Colour is also essential in that way because it impacts the mood of the people. For instance:</li><li><strong>Blue</strong> seems trustworthy and calm (common in banking).</li><li><strong>Green</strong> can represent nature, growth, or eco-friendly values.</li><li><strong>Red</strong>, on the other hand, catches the eye and is the typical colour of urgency.</li><li><strong>Purple</strong> may give a feeling of being elite or creative.</li></ul>'),
  p("When the color is used properly, it can be a guide for the users and, at the same time, focus the users on the key actions like \"Buy Now,\" \"Book,\" or \"Sign Up.\""),
  p("Text style (typography) is also important. Your writing should not be complicated at all, especially when it is on a phone. The fonts should be legible, the text should be of a good size (around 16px or bigger), and there should be contrast between the text and the background; these things make a big difference."),
  p("Headings must be used in a definite sequence to give the persons an opportunity to quickly glance over the page and get the main points, especially when they are pressed for time."),
  p("Finally, white space (empty space) is quite a vital factor. It not only makes the layout look neat but also allows the users to concentrate on the most significant parts without the feeling of being stressed. Companies like Apple employ an excessive amount of space to make things appear not only clear but also modern and of high quality."),
  h2("Interaction Design"),
  p("Interaction design revolves around how individuals use and respond to the interactive elements of a website or application, such as buttons, forms, and menus."),
  p("Buttons and call-to-action messages (CTAs) must be understandable at a glance and handle the least amount of work for the user: a button should, in fact, look like a button, not simply be text."),
  p('By using simple words like "Buy Now" or "Get Started," people should be able to understand the button\'s function at once, and it should be placed where people are most likely to look.'),
  p("The most valuable button should be the one that visually differs from the others so that users know which action is the first one to take."),
  p("Forms are highly important in interaction design for e-commerce as much as registration procedures."),
  p("Proper forms are brief and only request necessary information. Every field has to be self-explanatory and easy to fill in."),
  p("Autofill is handy, and dropdowns, as well as date selectors, facilitate the steps."),
  p("Users who make a mistake in filling a form should be carefully pointed out by error messages that help rather than confuse them."),
  p("In the UK, a lot of people find the Argos checkout form very simple, which is an example of how a well-thought-out form can be a great assistant."),
  p("There are also the tiniest things, known as micro-interactions, that are just as important."),
  p("For example, when a button changes its colour while the cursor is over it, the user being able to see a tick as confirmation or small loading animations can all be signals of the site responding without words."),
  p("People, without these small signs, might think that nothing happened, and, therefore, they would click again."),
  p("These little touches may be invisible to the eye when working separately, but when combined, they make the experience more efficient, user-oriented, and trustworthy."),
  h2("Accessibility"),
  p("Accessible designs are not extras; they are inherent features required in every website and app. The main reasons why accessibility matters are that the law needs it to be so in the UK, it is the right thing to do, and it brings more users to your product."),
  p("There are standards known as WCAG set up to guide businesses in making their digital platforms user-friendly for all. In the UK, to comply with the Equality Act 2010, most organizations follow WCAG 2.1 Level AA. The following are some instances of accessibility:"),
  list('<ul><li>Understandable text</li><li>Describing the photos so that the screen readers can explain them</li><li>Ensuring that a person can operate a website through a keyboard</li><li>Employing simple, clear words</li><li>Not using the flashing animation</li></ul>'),
  p("Accessibility is a concept that helps everyone, not only people with disabilities. For instance, subtitles assist people that are in silent places, clear menus help people that are in a hurry, and readable text helps elderly people or anyone that has eye strain."),
  p("Moreover, it is still convenient and affordable to create a design that is accessible to everyone from the very beginning rather than solving the issues later on."),
  p("On the other hand, UK law has strict provisions against neglecting accessibility issues. There is a list of UK companies that have been penalised with heavy fines because their websites were not user-friendly for all kinds of users."),
  p("However, apart from causing legal problems, making your business accessible to the disabled community opens it to approximately 14 million disabled users in the UK who are potential customers."),
  h2("Mobile Responsiveness"),
  p("A majority of people that live in the United Kingdom currently use their mobile phones to access the internet. Therefore, an easy-to-navigate website via a mobile phone is no longer considered an option but a necessity."),
  p("There are two common methods to create a mobile design:"),
  list('<ul><li><strong>Responsive design:</strong> First, you create a design for a desktop and then adjust the layout for smaller screens.</li><li><strong>Mobile-first design:</strong> Initially, you create a design for a phone and then extend it to bigger screens.</li><li>Since many people in the UK use mobile devices, designing mobile first generally results in a neater and more convenient user experience. It allows you to concentrate only on the essential things.</li><li>While creating a mobile version, you similarly need to consider the user\'s interaction with the device. Users tap with their fingers, not click with a mouse.</li><li>Buttons should be big enough for the user to tap comfortably.</li><li>The most important things to do should be easily accessible with your thumb.</li><li>Links and buttons should not be so close that it is difficult to distinguish them from one another.</li><li>Speed is another important factor here. Users of mobile devices want pages to be loaded quickly. If a site takes longer than three seconds to load, more than half of users leave. The UK is a place where the majority of people are on a mobile connection, not Wi-Fi. Therefore, the websites should take the following steps to increase the speed:</li><li>One of the most effective ways to increase the page loading speed is to compress the images that you want to upload to your website.</li><li>Eliminate components that are not necessary to keep the website running.</li><li>Make sure that the valuable content is shown first.</li></ul>'),
  p("None of these things, such as design, layout, speed, readability, and ease of use, exist separately from one another but together constitute a website. A website may be visually stunning, but if it takes ages to load or is difficult to tap with a finger, people will go elsewhere. And even in the event that everything functions perfectly, it will be of no use if users cannot find what they are looking for."),
  p("Good UX and UI are the components that achieve this and thus constitute a successful system yielding positive user experiences."),

  h1("The UX/UI Design Process: What to Expect"),
  img(`${imageDir}/UXUI Design UK image5.webp`, "The UX/UI Design Process: What to Expect"),
  p("Understanding the design process is beneficial for UK business owners, as it makes them realise what designers are actually doing and why it cannot be done quickly. If the process is hurried, errors will be made, and it will be very costly to fix them later."),
  h2("Discovery & Research Phase"),
  p("The discovery phase is essentially the origin of everything. During this phase, the design team spends time and immerses themselves in the knowledge of your company, your customers, and the problems you are looking to solve. It is a very crucial step because it helps to eliminate the act of guessing, and also, the design will be based on the real facts and figures."),
  p("Stakeholder interviews are pleasant chats between you, your team, and designers. Some of the queries they might put to you are:"),
  list('<ul><li>Really, what do you expect your app or website to achieve?</li><li>Is there anyone else doing the same work as you?</li><li>What would you say is the biggest problem that your customers have at the moment?</li><li>In what way will this project being successful be evident to you?</li></ul>'),
  p("These questions clear the fog of goals for the design team and help them to align their efforts with your objectives."),
  p("By competitor analysis, it is meant that a business should see what similar businesses are doing digitally—but not copy them."),
  p("The aim is to learn what works and what fails, as well as the potential positioning. For instance, if you are a British brand and others in the UK offer a quick checkout process, but you don't, then it is a matter to be considered."),
  p("The point may be to stand out if everyone appears to be the same."),
  p("User research is a method through which the design team gets feedback from the real users of the product or service."),
  p("They can perform a customer survey, interview users, or watch people while using the website."),
  p("For instance, running an online store in the UK, the research may indicate that users quit the process because payment options like Klarna or Apple Pay are not available, and that mobile users find it hard to filter ​‍​‌‍​‍‌​‍​‌‍​‍‌products."),
  h2("Strategy & Planning"),
  p("After the research phase, the designers transition to the planning stage, where they figure out how the design will actually function."),
  p("This is the point where insights become not only clear-cut but also practical steps."),
  p("Mapping out the user journey illustrates the entire route that users take in order to achieve their goals."),
  p("As a matter of fact, an online store could map the journey starting from the user seeing the brand on social media, then going to the website, checking the products, putting the goods in the basket, making the payment, and finally, returning as a customer."),
  p("This is very useful in identifying problem areas. For instance, customers might feel anxious at the moment of checkout because delivery costs are only revealed at the last step; thus, fixing this could have a great impact."),
  p("Information architecture deals with the company of not only your content but also features that are user-friendly and understandable."),
  p("Designers come up with easy site maps that illustrate how pages are linked together and the navigation flow."),
  p("They might also conduct an exercise where users are given topics, and they have to categorise them into groups that are logical, thereby ensuring that your website works in the same manner as the way people think, instead of just the way your company is organised."),
  p("Wireframing is similar to preparing a monochrome and simplified version showing the layout of your pages."),
  p("It illustrates the position of each element in addition to how users navigate the site without mulling over colours, photos, or the final content."),
  p("Making wireframes is not time-consuming, and they can be altered with minimal effort; therefore, you are able to try out different configurations and obtain feedback at an early stage."),
  p("For instance, you could be presented with three alternative homepage designs and select the one with the most effectiveness before proceeding with the full visual design."),
  h2("Design Phase"),
  p("This is the point at which the rough wireframes are converted into actual designs that demonstrate your website or app visually."),
  p("Design typically follows a progression of steps:"),
  p("<strong>Low fidelity:</strong> Basic drawings or wireframes. They're very quick, cheap, and only used to test the initial ideas."),
  p("<strong>Mid fidelity:</strong> More detail is included, and the brand style of your company starts coming through."),
  p("<strong>High fidelity:</strong> The ultimate design. It has real pictures, text, and colours, and even buttons and interactions are there, basically what the finished product will be like."),
  p("Prototypes are the clickable versions of your designs. They allow you to test how users will navigate your site or app without the need for coding. Thus, you can solve issues in the early stages and, therefore, save money later on."),
  p("Design systems and style guides are the tools that help keep everything consistent. They demonstrate what colours, fonts, buttons, icons, spacing, and layouts should look like."),
  p("For businesses that are expanding, these guides allow the addition of new pages or features to be done in a way that ensures everything still looks like it belongs together."),
  p("They are especially useful if more than one designer or developer is working on your project."),
  h2("Testing & Iteration"),
  p("Good design is not a thing that can be achieved in one shot; it requires testing and upgrading constantly."),
  p("Usability testing is the real user interaction on the site or app that you put under a spotlight while you observe. This could either be done in person or remotely. The user themselves will explain while using the site."),
  p("This helps you to know whether any of the things that you thought people would find easy are actually quite confusing, whether the checkout is difficult, or the important buttons (also known as the buy button) are clicked by the actual customer."),
  p("Mostly, in a test with 5-8 users, you are already going to be ahead of the curve as far as seeing all the main issues are concerned."),
  p("A good example would be a UK-based hotel website that has seen that users have difficulty in viewing the available rooms, or that they are unable to book rooms using the calendars because smartphones are not supported."),
  p("A/B testing is all about finding the better one by comparing the two versions. Could be two colours for buttons, two tag lines, or two page layouts."),
  p("Half your visitors are shown version A, the other half version B, and the results indicate which one is more effective. Thus, you make decisions based on real data rather than just guessing."),
  p("Once your site or app is live, don't stop asking users for their opinions. Feedback can be obtained from on-site forms, support calls, social media comments, reviews, or the tools that record where users click and scroll."),
  p("It enables you to find new problems and solutions for improvements."),
  p("Continuous improvement is about your design still being there after the launch. Launching your website is only version 1.0."),
  p("Top UK companies like Amazon are always making small changes based on feedback and data. When these types of changes take their course, the end users may enjoy better user experiences to a larger extent."),
  h2("Development Handoff"),
  p("It is necessary to have a bridge that connects design and development effectively if you want to ensure that your designs are constructed correctly."),
  p("Designers and developers must cooperate closely. Designers provide very detailed directions, such as the exact sizes, spacing, colours, fonts, and how things should work."),
  p("A tool like Figma helps developers to view their designs and get the information they need very easily. Having regular meetings helps to clarify questions quickly and also to ensure that the product matches the design."),
  p("Quality checks facilitate great results. This means confirming that the site or app:"),
  list('<ul><li>Visually corresponds to the design (visual QA)</li><li>Is capable of good performance (functional QA)</li><li>Are different browsers like Chrome, Safari, Firefox, and Edge supported?</li><li>Are different devices like phones and tablets supported?</li><li>Comply with accessibility standards (WCAG)</li></ul>'),
  p("For UK businesses, it is essential that testing be done on the most popular devices and browsers in the UK. What works on a MacBook in Chrome might not work on an iPhone in Safari."),
  p("Usually, design projects take from six weeks for small websites to six months for big apps. Although it may seem long, each step is still significant. Without research, design may be based on mere assumptions."),
  p("By skipping testing, one could mean launching a platform with problems that are able to be avoided. Doing things correctly from the beginning will save you time and money and will relieve you of unnecessary stress."),
  p("UK business owners know the process allows them to become better partners. You will understand when to provide feedback (early during wireframes, less during development), what questions to ask, and why rushing is not helpful."),
  p("The greatest outcomes are achieved when business owners provide information about their customers and market, while designers concentrate on producing the best user experience."),

  h2("Designing for Yourself, Not Your Users"),
  p("Among the most frequent errors and the ones that could cost the business owners a lot are the ones assuming that their choices are the customers' choices. Certainly, in most cases, it turns out to be a mistake."),
  p("For instance, maybe you like a very clean website with hidden menus, but your 55-year-old customers in Birmingham could find it confusing."),

  p("The way to a solution is real user involvement in design decisions through research and testing."),
  p("Your taste is important for your brand, but the way your website or app works should be based on what users need."),
  p("A London estate agent learned this the hard way; they made a beautiful website with artistic property photos and very little text. It won awards, but inquiries dropped 40% because people couldn't find key info like prices or room sizes."),
  h2("Ignoring Mobile Users"),
  p("While the majority of people in the UK use their phones for browsing, the fact remains that most businesses still predominantly design their websites for desktops and consider mobiles only as an afterthought."),
  p("Consequently, working with a site on a phone becomes a very frustrating experience. For instance, the buttons might be so small that it is almost impossible to tap them, the text may be so tiny that it needs zooming for reading, pages could be scrolling sideways without the user's knowledge, and forms might be complicated to fill out."),
  p("Mobile users are typically people who are on the move, have less patience, and may also have a slower internet connection."),
  p("A restaurant website that is great-looking on a computer but makes it difficult to view the menu or get the phone number on a mobile is losing customers every day."),
  p("UK users are very demanding when it comes to mobile websites, as they want them to be fast and easy, and if yours fails in this regard, they will be visiting your competitors."),
  h2("Overcomplicating Navigation"),
  p("Some companies in the UK aim to display every single thing they offer in their menus. As a consequence, there are enormous menus packed with copious choices, perplexing category names, and various methods to navigate, leaving the users indecisive about which option to select."),
  p("Proper navigation should be of low complexity and user-friendly. People like websites that keep to the standard patterns."),
  p("Instantly, your menu should answer the vital questions: What do you offer? What are the prices? Do I basically buy the product and get in touch with you? The rest, we shall see."),
  p("A software company in Manchester experienced this. Their menu had 47 items, which made it difficult for users to find the most important pages."),

  p("Poor accessibility not only puts businesses at risk of going against the law (Equality Act 2010), but it also means that they will lose customers. Approximately 1 in 5 people in the UK is a person with a disability."),
  p("Moreover, accessibility is beneficial for everyone: subtitles can be of help to people in a noisy environment, clear menus can be used by people who are busy, and good contrast can make text easily readable on bright screens."),
  h2("Inconsistent Branding"),
  p("Inconsistency damages trust and makes your business appear unprofessional. This is the case when your website has different fonts on different pages, button styles vary from page to page, colours change between sections, the writing style changes from formal to casual, or your mobile app looks completely different from your website."),
  p("Users notice these differences even if they cannot explain what is \"off.\" Consistency is a sign of professionalism and giving attention to detail."),
  p("Besides that, it makes your site more user-friendly; when buttons are always the same, users quickly understand which ones they can click."),
  p("A very particular online shop in the UK found that the inconsistency in design was so disgusting that customers simply walked out of the store without making a purchase. Some product pages had blue 'Add to Basket' buttons while others had green."),
  p("Some pages displayed prices clearly, while others hid them. After they made the design consistent, customer trust increased, and the number of people leaving without buying decreased; thus, sales went up by ​‍​‌‍​‍‌​‍​‌‍​‍‌18%."),
  h2("Skipping User Testing"),
  p("Many businesses across the United Kingdom have launched their websites or applications without verifying whether they are accessible to real users. It is like opening a restaurant without tasting the food; you do not know if customers will like it."),
  p("Testing with real users frequently uncovers issues. That feature you thought was straightforward? People can't find it."),
  p("With much-the-potential-of-an-intelligent-menu label, it baffles the people, of course. People sort of disappear after placing an order, checking up, but before pulling in the end."),
  p("It does not take up much money or time to be tested."),
  p("Even the observation of 5 people using your site can reveal major problems."),
  p("For instance, a learning platform in Bristol believed that its course menu was clear. However, when 3 people used it, they got lost and couldn't find the finished lessons."),
  p("The company saved itself from dissatisfied users and refund requests by fixing it before the launch."),
  h2("Not Optimising for UK Payment Preferences"),
  p("Customers from the UK are used to certain payment methods, and if you don't provide them, you might lose the customers."),
  p("The fact is that the British people like PayPal, Apple Pay, Google Pay, and Buy Now, Pay Later services like Klarna or Clearpay."),
  p("Cards continue to play a significant role in the life of UK consumers, but at the same time, by accepting cards alone, you will have people who will not transact business with you."),
  p("To be specific, a lot of young people are very heavy users of mobile wallets."),
  p("Moreover, UK buyers are very irritated by the so-called hidden costs. They are so frustrated with the extra delivery fees, which are the only ones that show up at the last step, that they leave without buying."),
  p("Being transparent with the costs, letting customers see the delivery options, and giving free delivery if they buy over a certain amount are ways to keep customers happy and confident to buy."),
  h2("Cluttered Layouts and Information Overload"),
  p("A lot of UK websites are trying to show so much at once that they end up confusing their visitors."),
  p("They have a multitude of buttons, large chunks of text, pop-ups, banners, and videos all at the same time. This is the reason as to why users get confused and exit the site."),
  p("Good design is all about keeping things simple. Decide what one thing you want your visitors to do on each of your pages and make that very easy to see."),
  p("The rest of the things are of less importance. Leaving some space between elements is very useful because it allows users to concentrate on the most important things."),
  p("As an example, Monzo's homepage is neat and straightforward with a single clear message."),

  p("Confusing menus cause users to leave your site and thus may lower your website's search ranking."),
  p("Non-accessible websites lose 1 out of 5 potential customers and may also invite legal issues."),

  p("Small projects, for instance, the creation of a single landing page, normally take from 2 to 4 weeks."),
  p("The redesign of a regular website is generally completed within 8 to 12 weeks, whereas the large-scale projects, such as the building of online stores or the development of apps, can take 3 to 6 months."),
  p("Time allotment for the work depends on a number of factors, such as the extent of the work, the volume of change requests, your team's approvals, and the necessity for user research."),
  h2("4. Do I really need professional design or can I use website templates?"),
  p("<strong>Templates:</strong>"),
  p("Ready-made website designs. Suitable for very small or new businesses that have simple needs."),
  p("<strong>Professional design:</strong>"),
  p("Custom made by experts. Required if your business is bigger, has an online store, or wants to be unique."),
  h2("5. How does good UX/UI design improve my conversion rates?"),
  p("A good design will allow more people to perform your desired actions on your site."),
  p("In fact, a highly optimised checkout decreases cart abandonment; easy navigation finds products faster for users; and clear buttons lead to more clicks."),
  p("An easy layout for mobile design retains the consumers on their smartphones, while honest and attractive designs will add to the comfort of the customers for their purchases."),
  p("Normally, businesses claim that after redesign, their conversion rates improved 50-400%."),
  h2("6. Is my website legally required to be accessible in the UK?"),
  p("Based on the UK law (Equality Act 2010), websites must be accessible to people with disabilities. If they aren't, companies may have to deal with legal consequences. Besides, an accessible website means that 14 million disabled people in the UK can use it."),
  h2("7. How do I know if my website needs a UX/UI redesign?"),
  p("Several indications exist that your website might be malfunctioning. One such indication is a high bounce rate, which is generally above 70% and is the main reason for visitors leaving the site quickly."),
  p("Low conversion rates, i.e., buyers, subscribers, or contacts, are also a symptom of a problem."),
  p("Moreover, the signs might be customers complaining about the difficulty of using the site, a website that looks old or outdated, bad performance on mobile devices, and losing customers to competitors."),
  p("Also, if getting information is difficult, it is an unequivocal signal that your site requires a change."),
  h2("8. Should I hire a freelancer or design agency?"),
  p("<strong>Freelancers:</strong> A single individual is responsible for your work. Less expensive, suitable for a small amount of work, and a direct communication line is established. However, they are unable to handle multiple tasks at the same time."),
  p("<strong>Agencies:</strong> A group of people collaborate to complete the work. Higher in price, but can be used for large projects and quicker results."),
  h2("9. What's the ROI of investing in UX/UI design?"),
  p("In the case of businesses in the United Kingdom, a mere one-pound expenditure aimed at enhancing the website or app usability of the user is capable of yielding a profit return of approximately one hundred pounds."),
  p("Improved design persuades more people to purchase or register, thus sales are typically doubled or even quadrupled."),
  p("Moreover, a customer-friendly website decreases the number of customer service calls, hence the cost of support is reduced by 25% to 40%."),
  p("The better design attracts the old customers to return, and thus the frequency of repeat visits increases by 20% to 35%."),
  p("Besides that, Google prefers a well-designed website, which helps it to be ranked higher in search results."),
  h2("10. Can I improve my website in phases or does it need complete redesign?"),
  p("In the event that your company is not willing to spend a lot of money at one time, you may upgrade your site step by step."),
  p("First, fulfil the most basic of tasks, such as making the site mobile device friendly and making the purchasing process as simple as possible, which would cost around 5,000-15,000."),
  p("The second thing to do is to focus on redesigning the most crucial pages of your website with the highest traffic, and the price will be about 10,000 to 25,000."),
  p("At last, work on the whole site to ensure that it is consistent and fully optimized,  which might cost from £15,000 to £40,000 or even more."),
  p("Utilising this gradual approach, you get to see the results early and have the opportunity to put in more later without the risk of losing money."),
  p("From wireframes to final design, we've got you covered."),
