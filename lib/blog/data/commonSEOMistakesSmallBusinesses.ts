Still, a majority of small business owners are making some typical SEO blunders, which are like invisible walls that block their online presence and business expansion."),

  p("Without performing keyword research correctly, small businesses might opt for wrong terms to target, which are either too competitive or completely irrelevant, thereby reducing their chances of getting ranked on the first pages of search results."),
  p("Another mistake that small businesses frequently make is the misuse of title tags and meta descriptions, which are among the major business-related mistakes that can impede your SEO performance."),
  p('Not remembering to optimise these factors may lead to a situation where the click-through rates from the search results will have been drastically lowered. Besides that, not paying <a href="/blog/best-local-seo-strategies-for-general-contractors" class="underline text-[#6FAF4E]">attention to local SEO</a> can be said to have caused a great neglect of local businesses.'),
  p("By not focusing on Google Business Profile optimisation and local keyword targeting, it is almost impossible for potential customers in your local area to find you."),

  h2("Impact of SEO Mistakes on Small Business Growth"),
  p("SEO mistakes have a huge negative influence on the development of a small business, to the point where these errors discourage potential customers from using your services online. Such mistakes are capable of diminishing online presence, thus turning the search for a business into a real challenge for new customers who rely on search engines to find you and don't have a proper understanding of your content."),
